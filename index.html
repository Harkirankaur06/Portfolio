            I’m a software engineering student who enjoys building clean,
            visually polished digital products that feel intentional and
            human-centered.

        <p>
          I’m currently a third-year B.Tech Computer Science student at
          Amity University, Noida. I love working on real-world tech
          solutions — especially where creativity meets solid engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I’ve built projects across web, mobile, AI, and game
          development — from AI-powered health assistants and sustainability
          tools to gamified awareness apps and interactive experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond development, I’m deeply involved in leadership and
          co-curricular activities. I serve as a Class Representative and
          actively participate in hackathons, technical clubs, and cultural
          events, often representing my university at national-level
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I’m especially interested in building interactive,
          visually rich experiences — the kind that make people want to
          explore, understand, and come back.
        </p>
